            I am an experienced web developer &amp; Interaction Designer. I have a strong passion for design detail,
            aesthetics and create stimulating and fluid user experiences. My goal as a designer is to create exciting
            human-computer interactions which are both innovative and intuitive but, above all else, inspire others.

            My other passions include: rock climbing, snowboarding, travel &amp; culture, tinkering with technology
            and meeting interesting people.

                    HelloPablo was the identity I used when doing commercial freelance work. I stopped trading
                    as HelloPablo once Shed Collective was formed. I still maintain this identity for personal
                    projects and my portfolio.
