                    A small plugin to generate a fake terminal on your website. Easily extendable to add support
                    for your own commands.

                    WideSlide is a slider designed to scale with the browser window. I needed
                    something which was capable of showing not only super wide images (without scrollbars) but
                    within which I could put any HTML.

                    On numerous occasions I have had a need (or desire) to reproduce Panic's Coda Slider. I
                    found a very nice tutorial on code For Designers and thought it would be good idea to
                    create a plugin for this.

                    While moving house I decided it would be a smart idea to sell all my junk on eBay. I sold about
                    50 items. While packaging up stuff it <strong>AMAZED</strong> me how many people are lazy and
                    don't capitalise their name, address or even their postcode. As it happens this is a
                    <strong>massive</strong> pet peeve of mine.

                    This plugin is a tool which writes the markup for a nivoSlider based on the contents of a
                    Flickr photoset or gallery. All you supply is your Flickr API key and the ID of the photoset
                    or gallery (and optionally choose which method you're using) and let the plugin take over.
